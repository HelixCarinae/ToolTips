(module+ test
  (require rackunit)
  (define test-list '(1 2 3))

## History 

### ctrl + r

First there's the wonder ctrl+r
```sh 
$ [ctrl+r] Fantast [enter]
$ less $HOME/networkHome/uni/cs/2613/frog/post/_src/date-Fantastic_Commands.md
```

### alt + . 
Pressing [**_alt+._**] inserts the parameter (you info) from the last command you used
```sh
$ ls -a $HOME/Desktop/files
$ nano [alt+.]/Fantastic_Commands
```

### bang bang he shot me down ! 
We also have !$ which does the same as [alt + .]
```sh
$ cat $HOME/networkHome/uni/cs/2613/frog/post/_src/date-Fantastic_Commands.md
$ less !$
```

there's more we can do with the bang however
```sh
cd ~/Desktop/animals
get http://www.cutepuppers.com/border_collie.jpg
w!! #this runs 'wget http://www.cutepuppers.com/border_collie.jpg' immediately 
cd ~/cats/all/the/cats
wget http://www.cutepuppers.com/labrador.jpg
mv ./labrador.jpg !-6&/dogs 

```
!! does the last command 
!n where n is the order you used the commands (this can be found with history)
!-y where y is the number you want to go back you have to add -1 to what you expect as running the command itself counts as history so !-1 just does !-1
adding $ strips the command part from it (like ls -a)
